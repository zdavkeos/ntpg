About - 
	Ntpg is loosely based on Meinberg's excellent
ntp monitoring program that is, unfortunatly, Windows only.
Ntpg only monitors the local machine, and the relevant 
executable must me in the PATH.

Installing -
	To build and run ntpg you will need:
    
    Fedora:
    	ntpd gtkmm2-devel libgtop2-devel
    Ubuntu:
        ntp libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgtop2-dev

	Once you have the sources, run:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

	To run:
	ntpg
