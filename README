About - 
	Ntpg is loosely based on Meinberg's excellent
ntp monitoring program that is, unfortunatly, Windows only.

Ntpg parses status data from ntpq and displays it in a nice gui. The
ntp* binaries must me in PATH.

Installing -
	To build and run ntpg you will need gtkmm3 and libgtop:
    
    Fedora:
    	ntpd gtkmm3-devel libgtop2-devel
    Ubuntu:
        ntp libgtkmm-3.0-dev libgtop2-dev

	Once you have the sources, run:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

	To run:
	ntpg
