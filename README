About - 
	Ntpg is loosely based on Meinberg's excellent
ntp monitoring program that is, unfortunatly, Windows only.
Ntpg only monitors the local machine, and the relevant 
executable must me in the PATH.

	ntpd gtkmm2-devel libgtop2-devel

	Once you have the sources, run:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

	ntpg

*ntpg is not affiliated with the NTP project
